## Description
The Team Profile Generator is an application that can be accessed through the command-line. It has been designed to simplify the process of creating a webpage that displays information about your development team. The application efficiently collects and organizes data for all team members, including managers, engineers, and interns. It leverages the Node.js environment along with the Inquirer package for user prompts. To ensure the reliability of the application, comprehensive testing is conducted using Jest.

## Technologies

<b>Inquirer:</b> Incorporates the Inquirer package to prompt users for input through the command line.</br>
<b>Jest Testing:</b> Implements Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, to perform unit tests and ensure the robustness of the application.</br>
<b>HTML Template:</b> Uses a predefined HTML template to structure and style the generated team profile.</br>
